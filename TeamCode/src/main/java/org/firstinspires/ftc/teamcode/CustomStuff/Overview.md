Where Were Gonna Part Our Custom Classes and interfaces (if Necessary).
What are Interfaces? Click  <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_interface.asp">Here</a> to find out. (I'm to lazy to explain)

## Is This Necessary?
Yes unless you want to deal with 30 class file and you forget which to import, besides it's good to be organized :3

### Sub-Directories?

Only do that if you really have to which i doubt you will, however robots require lots of code. Also if you are going to for whatever reason make sub directories including a overview file like this one explaining the purpose aka what does this thing even do and why is it here?
